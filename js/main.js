//Are you running the game in a server environment?
//If you don't, or don't know if you do:
//- It's okay I still like you;
//- You will need to double-click build.bat everytime you edit the characters, places or story files;
//- You'll start the game by double-clicking index.html or game.html
//- You don't need to touch anything below, you can close this file :)

//If you do:
//- Great, you can edit the characters, places and story files and see your changes immediately in the game;
//- Do not start the game by double clicking the html files, use your server path instead;
//- Comment init_local() and uncomment init_async(), and you're done :)
